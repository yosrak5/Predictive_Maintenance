Predictive maintenance is a proactive maintenance strategy that utilizes data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and sensor technologies to predict equipment failures before they occur.
By analyzing real-time and historical data, predictive maintenance aims to identify patterns and anomalies that signal potential issues, allowing maintenance teams to schedule repairs or replacements at optimal times.
